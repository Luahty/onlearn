                            Hello friends! I'm Huy from Vietnam. I am the founder of
                            dailydictation.com ðŸ¤—<br /> As a person who has used many different
                            methods to learn English, I realized that dictation is an amazing
                            way to improve my English. That's why I created this website to
                            help all English learners practice easily and effectively.<br />
                            Building and maintaining a website takes time, money and effort. I
                            need your help to keep the site running and to add more useful
                            features.<br /> If you can help me with money, awesome ðŸ¤©! You can send
                            me a donation to my PayPal / Bank accounts (see below).<br /> Another
                            great way to help me is to share this website with your friends.
                            ðŸ˜‡<br /> I sincerely appreciate your support! Thank you!!!!
